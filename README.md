# Meeting-Rooms
## A complete full-stack project

Created because of the proposed project by Digital Innovation Inc., to create a meeting rooms CRUD application .

The front-end part was made with Angular, SCSS, Angular Material and Typescript. The back-end part was made with Java, Spring boot and H2 database.

```shell script
ng serve
```
**or**

```shell script
npm start
```


**To execute the back-end part script in terminal:**

mvn spring-boot:run
```
